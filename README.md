# What

Programming Exercises and Question Answers as I read a couple of computer systems books*, and try to learn more Rust.

## Books

1.  Marius Bancila, The Modern C++ Challenge: A collection of programming exercises to be solved using C++. I'm 
    attempting to solve these in Rust, in order to pick up more Rust.
    
2.  Bryant & O'Hallaron, Computer Systems, a Programmer's Perspective. Will implement examples in C and Rust, in order
    to learn more Rust at a lower level.
